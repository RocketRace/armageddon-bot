# armageddon-bot

*Have you ever wanted to delete a server, but felt like it was too boring to simply delete it?* **Well, look no further!**

Armageddon-bot allows you to follow through with all your chaotic needs, with *four* different options for inciting cataclysm on your server! 

# DISCLAIMER: 
**This bot will have permanent effects on your server. Use at your own discretion.**

# Setup:

Python 3.6+ is required. The `discord.py[voice]` module is required (get it [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing)).

To run this bot, place a `config.json` file into the main folder. The file should contain two fields: 

`token`, your bot token, and 

`prefixes`, a string or an array of strings usable as command prefixes.

Run `bot.py` to launch your bot.

# Commands, i.e., Glorious Armageddon

Armageddon-bot is designed to cause cataclysm - catastrophe - carnage on any server it is used in. Armageddon-bot comes built-in with four different flavors of apocalypse, with varying degrees of destruction:

`the` - Armageddon-meter: Low

`zombie` - Armageddon-meter: Medium

`snap` - Armageddon-meter: High

`nuclear` Armageddon-meter: Very high
