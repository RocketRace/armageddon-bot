# armageddon-bot

*Have you ever wanted to delete a server, but felt like it was too boring to simply delete it?* **Well, look no further!**

Armageddon-bot allows you to follow through with all your chaotic needs, with *four* different options for inciting cataclysm on your server! 

# DISCLAIMER

**This bot will have permanent effects on your server. Use at your own discretion.**

All commands are only accessible by users with the Administrator permission. All commands will ask you for confirmation before making any permanent changes.

# Setup

Python 3.6+ is required. The `discord.py[voice]` module is required (get it [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installing)).

To run this bot, place a `config.json` file into the main folder. The file should contain two fields: 

`token`, your bot token, and 

`prefixes`, a string or an array of strings usable as command prefixes.

Run `bot.py` to launch your bot.

# Commands, i.e., Glorious Armageddon

Armageddon-bot is designed to cause cataclysm - catastrophe - carnage on any server it is used in. Armageddon-bot comes built-in with four different flavors of apocalypse, with varying degrees of destruction:

`the` - Armageddon-meter: Low

Perhaps the strangest armageddon of them all. Turns absolutely everything and everyone in the server into "the". Channels, roles, nicknames, emoji. Even changes the guild icon!

`zombie` - Armageddon-meter: Medium

A zombie apocalypse: The icon of all apocalypses! Raises masses of zombies from the ground, which will flood text channels. Infects users, crippling their ability to perform any actions.

`snap` - Armageddon-meter: High

"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be." Deletes half the whole server in the snap of a finger. Half of all channels, users, roles, everything. It's only right.

`nuclear` Armageddon-meter: Very high

Calls down swarms of nuclear missiles to bombard the server. This will destroy every channel and every member caught in the blasts. The following nuclear fallout will purge the weakest members, and slowly everything else will decay away. In the end, nothing remains. Nothing but the bitter dust of your choices.
