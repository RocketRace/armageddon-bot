A vial of sickly green fluid presents itself in front of you. The liquid is fully enclosed in glass, but it feels as if you can still smell it.

The liquid glows in a dangerous way. You know that it will do something terrible if in contact with the world. But even then, you are curious. What *would* happen?

=== **Do you grab the vial?** ===

*Respond with `yes` to grab it, and with anything else not to.*
