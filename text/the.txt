*"The".*

The word floats in the air, in front of you. Is it physical? Ethereal? Merely a projection? You cannot tell.

*"The".* That *one* word. Why that? Why here? You do not understand. You do not understand how you are perceiving it now. You do not understand why you are. But you are.

And it calls for you. *"The".* It's almost melodic... Like a siren's call. You want to join it. But should you?

*"The".* Once more, it sings its song. You catch a hint of just how much power this entity can have. Should you really follow it?

=== **Do you join the word?** ===

*Respond with `yes` to join, and with anything else not to.*
