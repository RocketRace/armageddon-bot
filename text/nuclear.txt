In front of you is a large shiny red button, encased in a perfect cube of glass.
You are mystified by the button, and attracted to it; you feel as if pressing the button is the only thing you want in this world.
However, there is also a short message imprinted on the glass. You clearly make out the words: `NUCLEAR STRIKE`

Your heart skips a step. You realize that pressing this button could mean the end of humanity as you know it.
And even so, it is so mesmerizing... You feel an itch in your mind as you contemplate your choices.

=== **Do you press the button?** ===

*Respond with `yes` to press the button, and with anything else not to.*
