A glorious gauntlet materializes in front of you. It shines with a material you have never seen before, with its golden curves seemingly shaped specifically for your hand.
The gauntlet is pristinely decorated in ornate patterns, but its most eye-catching feature is a group of six elaborately cut gems on the back of the gauntlet. 
Each stone shines with a different color. Five of the stones are placed on a finger joint, and the sixth largest gem rests squarely on the back of the hand. 
You sense immense power emanating from these stones. It feels as if this gauntlet has the power to shape the whole universe. And it's right there, in front of you...

The temptation of the gauntlet is unbelievable. However, you feel as if this gauntlet has a mind of its own... Its fingers are placed in a snapping position.

=== **Do you put on the gauntlet?** ===

*Respond with `yes` to wear the gauntlet, and with anything else not to.*
